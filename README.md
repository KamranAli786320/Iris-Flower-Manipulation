## 🧪 Work Performed (Project Working)

The following steps were successfully performed in this project:

1. **Dataset Loading**
   - Loaded `Iris.csv` using Pandas
   - Verified dataset shape and columns

2. **Data Inspection**
   - Checked first and last rows
   - Reviewed column names and data types
   - Generated statistical summary using `describe()`

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for missing/null values
   - Ensured dataset consistency
   - Renamed columns (if required) for clarity

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed feature distributions
   - Compared sepal and petal measurements
   - Explored relationships between features

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms for feature distribution
   - Scatter plots for feature relationships
   - Species-wise comparisons using plots

6. **Insights Generation**
   - Observed differences between iris species
   - Identified important features for classification
